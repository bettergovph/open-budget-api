## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** 20+ installed
- **Neo4j Database** 5.x running locally
- **Yarn** package manager
- **Git** for version control
- Budget data loaded from [open-budget-data](https://github.com/bettergovph/open-budget-data)

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**

   ```bash
   # Click "Fork" on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/open-budget-api.git
   cd open-budget-api
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Neo4j credentials
   ```

4. **Load budget data**
   - Follow instructions in [open-budget-data](https://github.com/bettergovph/open-budget-data) to import data into Neo4j
   - Verify your Neo4j database has the budget data loaded

5. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   yarn start:dev
   ```

6. **Verify the setup**
   - Open http://localhost:3000/api (Swagger documentation)
   - Test the health endpoint: http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health

## üìù Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

Branch naming conventions:

- `feature/` - New features or enhancements
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `test/` - Adding or updating tests
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `perf/` - Performance improvements

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code style and conventions
- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update relevant documentation

### 3. Write Tests

All new features and bug fixes should include tests:

```bash
# Run unit tests
yarn test

# Run E2E tests
yarn test:e2e

# Check test coverage
yarn test:cov
```

### 4. Format Your Code

Before committing, format your code:

```bash
yarn format
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add budget variance analytics endpoint"
```

Commit message format:

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### 6. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:

- Clear title describing the change
- Detailed description of what changed and why
- Reference to any related issues (e.g., "Closes #123")
- Screenshots or examples if applicable

## üìê Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Avoid `any` types - use specific types or generics
- Use async/await over promises

### NestJS Conventions

- Use dependency injection
- Follow module-controller-service pattern
- Use DTOs for request/response validation
- Document all endpoints with Swagger decorators

### Neo4j Query Guidelines

- Use parameterized queries (prevent injection)
- Optimize queries for performance
- Add comments for complex Cypher queries
- Test queries with large datasets
- Use EXPLAIN/PROFILE for query optimization
